## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

**Submitting issues is the preferred way to contribute.**

Before creating a pull request, **please submit an issue first**. This ensures that your contribution aligns with the project's goals and avoids duplication of effort. Issues allow for open discussion and feedback before significant work begins on a feature or fix.

If you find a bug in the project, please:

1. Check the [issues page](https://github.com/[your-username]/[repo-name]/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported.
2. If not, open a new issue and provide as much detail as possible:
    - A clear and descriptive title.
    - Steps to reproduce the problem.
    - Expected vs actual behavior.
    - Screenshots or logs (if applicable).

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for improving the project, please:

1. Open an issue with a title like `Enhancement: [Short Description]`.
2. Describe your idea in detail, including:
    - Why the enhancement is necessary.
    - How it improves the project.
    - Any potential drawbacks.
